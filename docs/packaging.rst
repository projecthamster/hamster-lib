Packaging
=========

``hamsterlib`` follows the `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_ scheme.
Each release is packaged and uploaded to `pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hamsterlib>`_.
We provide a compliant ``setup.py`` which contains all the meta information relevant to users of
``hamsterlib``. If you stumble upon any incompatibilities or dependency issue please let us know.
If you are interested in packaging ``hamsterlib`` for your preferred distribution or in some other
context we would love to hear from you!


About requirements/\*.txt
-------------------------
We do fully follow Donald Stuffts `argument <https://caremad.io/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/>`_ that
information given ``setup.py`` is of fundamentally different nature than what may be located under ``requirements.txt``
(Additional comments can be found in the `packaging guide <http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/requirements/>`_
and with `Hynek Schlawack <https://hynek.me/articles/sharing-your-labor-of-love-pypi-quick-and-dirty/>`_).
As far as packaging goes ``setup.py`` is authoritative. We provide a set of specific environments under
``requirements/*`` that mainly developers and 3rd parties may find useful. This way we can easily enable contributers to get
a suitable ``virtualenv`` running or specify our test environment in one central location.
If for example you wanted to package ``hamsterlib`` for ``debian-stable``, it would be mighty convenient to
just provide another requirements.txt with all the relevant dependencies pinned to what your target distro
would provide. Now you can run the entire test suit against a reliable representation of said target system.
