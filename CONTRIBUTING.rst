Write Documentation

articles, and such.

  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `hamster-lib` for local development.

1. Fork the `hamster-lib` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:projecthamster/hamster-lib.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed,
   this is how you set up your fork for local development. It will also take care of
   installing all packes required for a dev environment::

    $ mkvirtualenv hamster-lib
    $ cd hamster-lib/
    $ make develop
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the tests,
   including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ make test-all

   For your intermediate quick-and-dirty testruns that include just the unittests, run::

     $ make test

   If you just want to check against a specific python (``py27`` or ``py34``) version, run::

     $ tox -e py27

   or::

     $ tox -e py34


6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests. Preferably they will not lower the total
   test coverage of the project.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7 and 3.4. Check `Travis
   <https://travis-ci.org/projecthamster/hamster-lib/builds/142418469>`_
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

    $ python -m unittest tests.test_hamster_lib
